                                        Abortion is illegal in Cyprus up to the extent 
                                        of a 14 years prison sentence except under 
                                        certain narrowed exceptions. Nevertheless, 
                                        European Union Law considers abortion as a 
                                        ‘Service’ and most of the EU Member States 
                                        have sufficiently more relaxed access to abortion 
                                        services than Cyprus currently does. Taken as 
                                        granted that EU Law explicitly overrides Cyprus 
                                        national law, even on the criminalisation of abortion, 
                                        it follows that any Cypriot woman can vindicate her
                                        access to abortion, through the EU principle of 
                                        freedom of services. This is in relation not only 
                                        in establishing access to abortion, but also in 
                                        claiming refund for up to the total costs that occurred 
                                        to the Cyprus woman by being forced to travel to another 
                                        Member State in fulfilling such task.
